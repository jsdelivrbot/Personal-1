transpiler - a transpiler reads the code in one language and produces the equivalent code in another.

why do we need transpilers?
1. browsers currently have support of older JS
2. Transpilers convert modern javascript code into original js.

Babel
transpiles es6 code back into es5 which browser support.

Features

1. new keywords
2. Template literals in es6 are strings with embedded variables 
  or code inside. They have surrounding backticks `` with interpolated ${} symbols for variables.
3. spread operators The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple elements/variables/arguments are expected.The es6 
   spread operator spreads the contents of an array or object into multiple variables. Its syntax uses three periods, just like so: …
4   Destructuring Assignment  in es6 allows us to extract data from arrays or objects into separate, distinct variables.
5 Destructing Array - assigns multiple variables from an array. For instance, let [a, b] = c, where values ‘a’ and ‘b’ assign in order to the respective elements in ‘c’.
6. Destructiong Objects - assigns multiple variables form an object. For instance, let { a, b } = c, where values ‘a’ and ‘b’ assign to the ‘a’ and ‘b’ properties in ‘c’.
7. Arrow functions work like normal method expressions in JavaScript, but with a shorter syntax.
   They also have the added benefit of being anonymous. In addition, unlike normal JavaScript function, they do not bind the this object to their function scope.
8. Modules in javascript are reusable pieces of code within our application. As our application grows we need to split code into multiple files so that it can be reusable , testable and maintainable.
  Modules refer to reusable pieces of code that often exist independently in their own separate files.

keywords in es6
1. let in place of var - let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement,
                         or expression on which it is used. This is unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable
                         'globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.

2. const - value cannot be re-assigned but we can manipulate it. 
          for example: arr=[1,2,3] // arr=3+1 throw an error while arr.push(4) is valid.
3. export - Export in es6 sends functions, objects, or primitive values from one module to another.
            export the keywords and its values. You can  use export default keyword to give named function of the module .
            It can be use as a fallback. example: export {add, multiply} // add and multiply are two funtions
4. import - Import in es6 receives functions, objects, or primitive values from another module.

   The default export represents a fallback or “main” value/function for a module. You cannot write the export default syntax and declare variables on the same line.
